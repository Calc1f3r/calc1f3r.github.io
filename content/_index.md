I'm an Information Systems Engineer (still missing one last subject) at **Universidad de Alcal√°** with a strong interest in **cybersecurity**. Throughout my academic journey, I‚Äôve taken part in diverse experiences that shaped both my technical skills and my adaptability. I spent a year abroad in **Poland** through the **Erasmus+** program.
{{< /lead >}}

I have explored **SBCs** through the **NVIDIA Jetson Nano Grant** and homelab projects, experimented with different technologies as an intern for the **Eurobot** robotics program and strengthened my understanding of cybersecurity by attending conferences such as **RootedCON**, **C1b3rwall** or **Osintomatico**. I also participated in hands-on initiatives like a **Hardware Hacking Bootcamp** and **EUGLOH Living Lab**, which allowed me to collaborate with students and professionals from different countries and disciplines.

My goal right now is to continue growing as an engineer while deepening my expertise in cybersecurity. I aim to develop myself both technically and personally, contributing to innovative projects with **curiosity, creativity and willingness to learn**.
